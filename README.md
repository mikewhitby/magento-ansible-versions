# Magento Versions Box

Based on my [Magento Ansible box] [1], but with a slant towards running
multiple versions of Magento on the same box with demo data. This box would be
good for extension developers who need to run multiple versions of Magento.

I've kept this seperate in case people want to fork the other box, but they
don't want the stuff that is in here, most likely because it will be a more
specific nature.
